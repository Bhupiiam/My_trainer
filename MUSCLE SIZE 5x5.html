<h1>ABOUT MUSCLE GROWTH</h1>
<p>After you workout, your body repairs or replaces damaged muscle fibers through a cellular process where it fuses muscle fibers together to form new muscle protein strands or myofibrils. These repaired myofibrils increase in thickness and number to create muscle hypertrophy (growth).1 Muscle growth occurs whenever the rate of muscle protein synthesis is greater than the rate of muscle protein breakdown. This adaption, however, does not happen while you actually lift the weights. Instead, it occurs while you rest.</p>
<h2>3 Mechanisms That Make Muscles Grow</h2>

<h2>1. Muscle Tension</h2>
<p>In order to produce muscle growth, you have to apply a load of stress greater than what your body or muscles had previously adapted too. How do you do this? The main way is to lift progressively heavier weights. This additional tension on the muscle helps to cause changes in the chemistry of the muscle, allowing for growth factors that include mTOR activation and satellite cell activation.3
</p>
<h2>2. Muscle Damage</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever felt sore after a workout, you have experienced the localized muscle damage from working out. This local muscle damage causes a release of inflammatory molecules and immune system cells that activate satellite cells to jump into action. This doesn’t mean that you have to feel sore in order for this to happen, but instead that the damage from the workout has to be present in your muscle cells. Typically soreness is attenuated over time by other mechanisms.
</p>
<h2>3. Metabolic Stress</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever felt the burn of an exercise or had the “pump” in the gym, then you’ve felt the effects of metabolic stress. Scientists used to question bodybuilders when they said the “pump” caused their muscles to become larger. After more investigation, it seems as though they were onto something.
</p>
<h1>How to build muscle and size</h1>
<p>1.Eat enough calories.</p>
<p>2.Eat sufficient high-quality protein.</p>
<p>3.Don't let the 'low fat' myth ruin your goals.</p>
<p>4.Fuel your workouts with carbohydrate and creatine.</p>
<p>5.Be at your best with more sleep and less stress.</p> 
<p>6.Be Smart And Choose The Most Effective Muscle Building Exercises.</p> 
<p>7.Don't Burn Away Your Muscle Gains With Too Much Cardio</p>

<h1>WORKOUT PLAN</h1>
<iframe src="MUSCLESIZE 2.pdf" height="900px" width="950px"></iframe>
<h1>Why Muscles Need Rest To Grow</h1>
<p>
If you do not provide your body with adequate rest or nutrition, you can actually reverse the anabolic process and put your body into a catabolic or destructive state. The response of muscle protein metabolism to a resistance exercise bout lasts for 24-48 hours; thus, the interaction between protein metabolism and any meals consumed in this period will determine the impact of the diet on muscle hypertrophy.5 Keep in mind there is a certain limit on how much your muscles can actually grow dependent on gender, age, and genetics. For instance, men have more testosterone than women, which allows them to build bigger and stronger muscles.
</p>
<h1>How Muscles Grow: Conclusion</h1>
<p>
For muscle breakdown and growth to occur you must force your muscles to adapt by creating stress that is different than the previous threshold your body has already adapted to. This is can be done by lifting heavier weights, continually changing your exercises so that you can damage more total muscle fibers and pushing your muscles to fatigue while getting a “pump.” After the workout is completed, the most important part begins which is adequate rest and providing ample fuel to your muscles so they can regenerate and grow.
