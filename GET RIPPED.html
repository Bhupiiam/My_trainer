<h1>NUTRUTION PLAN</h1>
<iframe src="GET RIPPED 1.pdf" height="900px" width="950px"></iframe>
<h1>WHAT IS NUTRITION PLAN</h1>

<p>A healthy eating plan gives your body the nutrients it needs every day while staying within your daily calorie goal for weight loss. A healthy eating plan also will lower your risk for heart disease and other health conditions.
</p>
<h2>A healthy eating plan:</h2>

<p>Emphasizes vegetables, fruits</p>
<p>whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products</p>
<p>Includes lean meats,poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts</p>
<p>Limits saturated and trans fats, sodium, and added sugars</p>
<p>Controls portion sizes</P>
<h2>Calories</h2>
<p>To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from food and beverages (energy IN) and increase their physical activity (energy OUT).
</p>
<p>For a weight loss of 1–1 ½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. 
<h2>In general:</h2>
<p>
<p>Eating plans that contain 1,200–1,500 calories each day will help most women lose weight safely.</p>
<p>Eating plans that contain 1,500–1,800 calories each day are suitable for men and for women who weigh more or who exercise regularly.</p>
<p>Very low calorie diets of fewer than 800 calories per day should not be used unless you are being monitored by your doctor.</p>
<h1>WORKOUT PLAN</h1>
<iframe src="GET RIPPED 2.pdf" height="900px" width="950px"></iframe>
<h1>What type of exercise should you do?</h1>
<p>There is no single type of exercise that can take care of all your needs. In fact, to get the most benefits from your routine, you want a mix of activities during the course of a week. Otherwise, it’s like a diet consisting only of fruit—healthful as far as it goes, but lacking a lot of the nutrients you’ll find in other foods, such as fish, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains.
</p>
<h2>Aerobic exercise (cardio)</h2>
<p>Often called cardio or endurance activities, aerobic activities are great for burning calories and paring down unwanted fat. They consist of activities that make the heart and lungs work harder: think of walking, biking, running, and swimming
</p>
<p>Aerobic exercise temporarily boosts your heart rate and breathing, allowing more oxygen to reach your muscles and tuning up cardiovascular endurance. These are the activities that are associated with lower risk for many diseases and longer life span.</p>
</p>

<h2>Strength training</h2>
<p>Strength or resistance training, which typically employs equipment such as weight machines, free weights, or resistance bands or tubing, protects against bone loss and builds muscle. It also improves your body’s ratio of lean muscle mass to fat. It, too, deserves an important place in your exercise routine.
</p>
<p>Technically, strength or resistance training takes place any time your muscles face a stronger-than-usual counterforce, such as pushing against a wall or lifting a dumbbell. Using progressively heavier weights or increasing resistance makes muscles stronger. Aside from toning you, strength training provides the functional strength you need to do everyday activities— lifting groceries, climbing stairs, rising from a chair, rushing for the bus—with ease.
</p>
<h2>Flexibility exercises</h2>
<p>Flexibility exercises like stretching and yoga gently reverse the shortening and tightening of muscles that typically occur with disuse and age. Shorter, stiffer muscle fibers may make you vulnerable to injuries and contribute to back pain and balance problems.
</p>
<h1>Why follow this workout program?</h2>
<p>The workout plans below are designed to reduce the chances of hitting a plateau (when your muscles stop growing).
</p>
<p>They do this by employing the right exercises, the right number of sets, the right order of exercises, and the right amount of rest time in between sets and exercise days so you can recover.
