<h1>How drugs affect your body </h1>

<p>Different types of drugs affect your body in different ways, and the effects associated with drugs can vary from person to person. How a drug effects an individual is dependent on a variety of factors including body size, general health, the amount and strength of the drug, and whether any other drugs are in the system at the same time. It is important to remember that illegal drugs are not controlled substances, and therefore the quality and strength may differ from one batch to another. 
Drugs can have short-term and long-term effects. These effects can be physical and psychological, and can include dependency.

You may act differently, feel differently and think differently if you have taken drugs. And you may struggle to control your actions and thoughts.</p>
<h1>different effects of drugs</h1>
<p>Some people can’t digest dairy products from childhood and others acquire this issue later on. Lactose intolerance usually affects African American and Asian women over 40. At this age, the level of lactase enzyme that helps digest lactose decreases. As a result, milk can’t be digested and causes large intestine issues.<p>

<h1>Depressants</h1>
<p>slow or 'depress' the function of the central nervous system. They slow the messages going to and from your brain. In small quantities depressants can cause a person to feel relaxed and less inhibited. In large amounts they may cause vomiting, unconsciousness and death. Depressants affect your concentration and coordination, and slow your ability to respond to situations. It is important to not operate heavy machinery while taking depressants. Alcohol, cannabis, GHB, opiates (heroin, morphine, codeine) and benzodiazepines (minor tranquillisers) are examples of depressants.</p>
<h1>Hallucinogens</h1>
<p>distort your sense of reality. You may see or hear things that are not really there, or see things in a distorted way. Other effects can include emotional and psychological euphoria, jaw clenching, panic, paranoia, gastric upset and nausea. Ketamine, LSD, PCP, 'magic mushrooms' and cannabis are examples of hallucinogens.</p>
<h1>Stimulants</h1>
<p>speed or 'stimulate' the central nervous system. They speed up messaging to and from the brain, making you feel more alert and confident. This can cause increased heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature, reduced appetite, agitation and sleeplessness. In large amounts stimulants may cause anxiety, panic, seizures, stomach cramps and paranoia. Caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines (speed and Ice), cocaine and ecstasy (MDMA) are examples of stimulants.</p>
<h1>Physical harms from drug use</h1>
<p>You are more likely to have an accident (at home, in a car, or wherever you are). </p>
<p>You may find it hard to sleep, think, reason, remember and solve problems.
Drug use can also result in long-term health outcomes that include:</p>
<p>harm to organs and systems in your body, such as your throat, stomach, lungs, liver, pancreas, heart, brain, nervous system</p>
<p>cancer (such as lung cancer from inhaling drugs)</p>
<p>infectious disease, from shared injecting equipment and increased incidence of risk-taking behaviors </p>
