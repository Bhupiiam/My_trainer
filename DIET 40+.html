<h1>What Happens to Your Body After 40 </h1>
<h1> Our hair becomes less dense.</h1>
<p>This problem occurs mostly in men but many people lose their thick hair before they turn 30, and 53% of men go bald after 40. Women also lose hair but slower than men. Yes, it’s unpleasant but there’s also an advantage: your body hair stops growing too.</p>
<h1>Lactose intolerance may occur.</h1>
<p>Some people can’t digest dairy products from childhood and others acquire this issue later on. Lactose intolerance usually affects African American and Asian women over 40. At this age, the level of lactase enzyme that helps digest lactose decreases. As a result, milk can’t be digested and causes large intestine issues.<p>
<h1>Our teeth become less sensitive.</h1>
<p>If you suffer from teeth sensitivity while you’re young, this problem may vanish when you get older. It happens because of dentin, a calcified tissue that grows as time passes. That’s why sensitivity reduces.</p>
<h1>Our metabolism decreases.</h1>
<p>If at 40, you eat the same food as you used to eat at the age of 20, you’ll gain weight really fast. The thing is, after 40 our metabolism decreases and we lose muscle faster. Dr. Kathryn Boling says that the average woman gains around 15 lbs between the ages of 40 and 55.</p>
<h1>Our hearing and vision may get worse.</h1>
<p>At the age of 40, people start experiencing far-sightedness or other eyesight issues: as a rule, people need more light to read and they also notice changes in color perception. Another eyesight problem is dry eyes.

Our hearing worsens too. It happens because of changes in the structure of the tympanic membrane and the inner ear.</p>
<h1>Our sense of taste changes</h1>
<p>When we’re born, we have around 9,000 taste receptors. When we get older, the amount of these receptors reduces and we start losing some taste sensation, usually beginning with salty and sweet tastes and then bitter and sour ones. By the way, these changes occur in women earlier than in men.</p>
